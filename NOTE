- The model will learn anything intrinsically as long as the model architecture is sufficiently complex
Therefore, we do not need to explicitly convert residual into RGB, as over time, it will learn to self convert to RBG 
to minimize loss. Although, this begs the question, is a guide required. If yes, how will you guide it.

- What is the 1500 step barrier. 

- What is the limit of the architecture. Is there a better, self learning architecture that can add and remove neurons.
